# Architecture

This section describes the project's architecture. Please read it thoroughly before contributing to the project.


## Environment

The Android App is written using [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) 1.3 and [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) 3.6. Both the build process and the dependency management are handled by [Gradle](https://gradle.org/).

The development process leverages also the following technologies:

-   [CommitLint](https://commitlint.js.org/#/). A linter for commits, CommitLint is released as an open-source project under the MIT licence.
-   [Danger](https://danger.systems/js/). A system to enforce code quality and contribution rules in pull requests, Danger is released as an open-source project under the MIT licence.
-   [ktlint](https://ktlint.github.io/). A linter for Kotlin code, ktlint is maintained by Pinterest and released as an open-source project under the MIT licence.


## Repository structure

The app architecture is built on [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/). When it comes to the project‚Äôs structure, Immuni is implemented using a data-driven MVVM architecture that follows the recommendations laid out in the [Android guide to app architecture](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide).

The app module is grouped by concerns. In particular:

-   **UI**. This contains the presentation layer: the [Activities](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity), [Fragments](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/fragments), and [ViewModels](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel).
-   **Api**. This contains the backend API interfaces and the [Data Transfer Objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transfer_object) (DTO).
-   **Logic**. This contains the managers, the repositories, and the domain models, grouped by entity.
	-   **Managers**. These present data as [Flows](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/flow.html)  and  actions as suspending functions ([Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html)).
	-   **Repositories**. These interact with the data sources (local storage and network).
	-   **Models**. These represent the domain entities.
-   **Workers**. This contains the [Workers](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/work/Worker) that run in the background periodically.
-   **Receivers**. This contains all the [BroadcastReceivers](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/BroadcastReceiver).

The app uses [androidx](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx)-namespaced libraries.

## Modules

The app project is subdivided into a set of modules to improve separation of concerns and readability:

-   **App**. This contains the UI, the domain logic and the data layer.
-   **Debug Menu**. This provides helpers meant to simplify the development and QA processes. This module is not shipped in production builds.
-   **Extensions**. This contains a set of extensions and helpers.
- **Network**. This contains base http client configuration and response error handling.


## Code style

The source code follows the official code style from [kotlinlang.org](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coding-conventions.html) and [Android Kotlin Style Guide](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/style-guide), leveraging the [Ktlint](https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint) tool.

We have decided not to include the linter or the formatter as build phases to prevent increasing the application build time, but you can run the following commands to check the code style and automatically correct any styling issues:

```sh
./gradlew ktlintCheck
./gradlew ktlintFormat
```

When a new pull request is opened, the CI checks for formatting or linting issues. Please solve them before we can proceed with the review.


## Testing

The repository contains several unit and integration tests to guarantee high code quality and maintainability.

To run the local unit tests, execute the following Gradle task from the desired app module:
```sh
./gradlew :[module name]:testDebugUnitTest
```

To run the instrumentation/UI tests, execute the following Gradle task:
```sh
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest
```

When contributing with a pull request, please make sure that the existing test passes and that relevant tests are added for the changes you are introducing.

# Gitflow

This repository adopts a branch management system inspired by [Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow). However, given that, in Android and iOS, continuous delivery is not possible, branches are used in a slightly different manner.

The main branches are as follows:

- **Master**. The _master branch_ contains the codebase that has reached the production environment (i.e., the App Store or Google Play). Commits are manually merged in this branch by project maintainers when a new build reaches the production environment.
- **Development**. The _development branch_ is where development takes place. This branch serves as an integration branch for features and fixes‚Äîit could be considered the unstable beta branch.

## Feature and fixes

When contributors wish to implement a new feature or a fix, they should branch from the development branch and open a pull request. Branches should have a meaningful name that adheres to the following convention:

```
<type>/name_of_feature_or_fix.
```

The _type_ prefix should be one of the following:

- **feature**. Used in the case that the branch implements a new feature.
- **fix**. Used in the case that the branch implements a fix.

Valid branch names are:

- _feature/onboarding_
- _fix/paddings_

Invalid branch names are:

- _feat/onboarding_
- _fix_paddings_

## Releases

When the code is ready for a new release, a new release branch is cut from development. From the [Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) website:

_Once development has acquired enough features for a release (or a predetermined release date is approaching), you fork a release branch off from development. Creating this branch starts the next release cycle, so no new features can be added after this point‚Äîonly bug fixes, documentation generation, and other release-oriented tasks should go in this branch._

During this stage, the focus is on preparing the release by fixing issues. It is not possible to add new features to the codebase.

Once Apple and/or Google approve the build, the release branch is merged in both development and master.

# Commits

Please follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/) naming convention for consistency and to avoid problems with our continuous integration systems. The automatic systems also perform checks and mark as not ready for review any pull request that it determines has not followed the convention.

# How to contribute

When you encounter a bug or an issue with the system represented in this repository, you may choose to let the developers know the nature of the issue.

The Immuni project is composed of different repositories‚Äîone for each component or service. If you wish to raise something strictly relevant to this repository (i.e., an Android bug), please read on. However, to raise other issues or to highlight other bugs, please open an issue in the [Documentation repository](https://github.com/immuni-app/documentation). This lets everyone involved see it, consider it, and participate in the discussion, without slowing down the overall process.

## Issues

Before filing a new issue, please browse the relevant section and use the search functionality to check if it has already been filed by someone else.

- If this issue has previously been filed, please do not create a new one. Instead, add more information to the existing issue, or simply add the üëç symbol to the first message. This helps the project maintainers to identify issues and prioritise accordingly.
- If the issue has not already been filed, please create a new one.

### Creating a new issue

When creating a new issue, there are three categories:

- Bug report
- Android client feature request
- General issue

Please ensure that you select the appropriate category for the issue. Each one has a unique template designed to elicit the information required to reproduce and fix the issue. If the issue does not fall under _Bug report_ or _Android client feature request_, please select _General issue_. With a general issue, it is especially important to provide a significant amount of detail, to help the project maintainers and any other collaborators understand the issue clearly.

When an issue is opened, a triage label is automatically assigned. The project maintainers are automatically notified of the issue's creation‚Äîthey endeavour to address all issues as quickly as possible. When the issue has been triaged, a corresponding label will be assigned. Here is a list of [all the possible labels](#labels).

### Good first issues

If you are interested in contributing to Immuni but are unsure where to start, please search for issues with the Good first issue label. These issues are relatively easy tasks that can help you get familiar with the code.

## Pull requests

After opening an issue, you may want to help the developers further. If the issue has been triaged and if the project maintainers give the green light, you may propose a solution. Doing so is always appreciated. For this, please use the Pull Request tool.

Before proceeding, please ensure that your proposal relates to an issue that has already been reviewed.

The first step in opening a pull request is to fork the project. Please log in to your account, then select Fork in the repository's landing page. This allows you to work on a dedicated fork and push your changes there. Then, if you wish to apply these changes back in the main Immuni repository, create a pull request targeting this repository. For more detailed information, [please read this guide](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).

When creating a pull request, please choose a name that adheres to the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/) naming convention. It is important to review and follow this convention before creating a pull request. This ensures that the commit history remains clean and makes it easy to identify what each commit does.

After choosing the appropriate name, please use the following template for the body of the pull request:
